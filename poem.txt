My Software Developer Journey

Started on Grasshopper Platform
Migrated to freeCodeCamp.org
Later introduced to CodePen.io
Used W3Schools to navigate unfamiliar territories
Google became my best friend
Code.org was so much fun
Then came CYFBlocks
I thought I would not make it through this one
But Graduation day reminded me how tough I was
And if not for the Mentors and Collaborators along this journey
I sure may have given up...
Thank God for Tersia who sent me the CYF link
I loved collaborating with my team on GoogleMeets
Thank you to Chandre for unselfishly giving of her time to help me navigate areas I felt stuck in
Thank you to Douglas who helped me to see that being stuck should not mean I should throw in the towel
And look where I am today, not by own accord
But by those Divinely Orchestarted by God above
Three words...
Thankful
Forwardlooking
Excited
